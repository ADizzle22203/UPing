UPing is a program available for Windows operating systems to help receive more information about an access point. UPing can be useful for
watching the status of multiple servers, instantly pinging an I.P, and receiving extra data that normal commands won't give you.

UPing will most-likely be available for other operating systems soon (like macOS and Linux.)
